We've published a new paper with the title "Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration Using Piece-Wise Tricubic Polynomials as Transformation Model" on [preprints.org](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202310.1120/v1).

The method is open source as mentioned in this former [blog post](https://pglira.github.io/github/code/2023/10/11/new-open-source-non-rigid-registration-method.html):
1. [3D_nonrigid_tricubic_pointcloud_registration](https://github.com/AIT-Assistive-Autonomous-Systems/3D_nonrigid_tricubic_pointcloud_registration): this is an efficient implementation of the algorithm for the 3D space written in C++
2. [2D_nonrigid_tricubic_pointcloud_registration](https://github.com/AIT-Assistive-Autonomous-Systems/2D_nonrigid_tricubic_pointcloud_registration): this is a prototype implementation of the algorithm for the 2D space only written in Matlab
