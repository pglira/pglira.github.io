The ``simpleICP`` [repository on Github](https://github.com/pglira/simpleICP) contains implementations of a rather simple version of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm in various languages.

Currently, an implementation is available for C++, Julia, Matlab, Octave, and Python.

What's new?

- The python implementation of the simpleICP algorithm is now available on PyPi, see [here](https://pypi.org/project/simpleicp)
- The implementations in julia, matlab, octave, and python support now partial overlap of the point clouds to be aligned
